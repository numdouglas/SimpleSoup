Academia research custom notifier
This is a project I made so I could be notified of any freelance job postings in Academia Research which is one of the sites I freelance in ahead of the others.
Going to the website itself and constantly refreshing is not tenable, especially with a busy schedule, while freelancing some other work or on the move.
Therefore, I take adbvantage of the ubiquity of Android to make a HTMLUnit web spider covered in more informative, interesting UI. It will present exclusive projects in my field
of interest in a notification and hyperlinked UI, ensuring I am early to be notified without much strain.
